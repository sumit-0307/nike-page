## Nike Landing Page üèÄ

This is a simple and modern Nike landing page I built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

The page features a clean design, responsive layout(partially, cuz idk how tf tailwind's new version 4.0 works and had problems while creating custom utilities so had to use style formats directly inline within the code in some places) and showcases Nike products with a smooth user interface.

Designed as a front-end practice project to improve skills in modern UI development (Also cuz I was bored asf so might as well try some new tailwind skills)
